**Zero-to-Mastery by [Andrei Neagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie)**

## Challenge

Your challenge is to use the below APIs (pick your favourite) and build something fun:

Star Wars API or Star Wars API (clone)

Numbers API

**Chuck Norris API** (what i've picked)

Pokemon API

International Space Station API (gives you the coordinates to where the international space station is!)

Using one of the above APIs, build a single page application that uses fetch() to retrieve information and display it on your website.
